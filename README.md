### 2. Describe the problems that might arise from scaling such a game on one machine.
   The problems that might arise from scaling such a game on one machine could
   be the same problems that happened to me in my last project(Object Detection) when i tried to run the training command,
   it had to run for a long time. With million of bees in all stages moving around, my computer would probably crash, this is why
   clouds/hadoops developed, these apps using maps reduce in order to make things more accesible by using multiple machine
   at the same time and by this making  all the process more efficient and faster.
   more advantage could be that more machines easily added if necessary, And a failure of one machine arn't leading to failure of the entire system
   other machines can still communicate with each other.
   
### 3. Describe the problems that might arise from scaling such a game in a distributed environment.
   1.It is difficult to provide adequate security in distributed systems because the nodes as well as the connections need to be secured.
   2.Some messages and data can be lost in the network while moving from one node to another.
   3.The database connected to the distributed systems is quite complicated and difficult to handle as compared to a single user system.
   4.Overloading may occur in the network if all the nodes of the distributed system try to send data at once.
   
### 6. How would you model & analyze the family lineage tree of a bee
   Swarming is the process by which honey bee colonies reproduce to form new colonies. 
   When a honey bee colony outgrows its home, become too populated for the queen’s pheromones to control the entire workforce,
   then the workers signal that it is![Cover_suggestion_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108065131/185953878-deae613e-548d-4fbc-9639-27a57b731772.jpg)
 time to swarm. The workers begin building swarm cells for new queens. 
   Once the swarm cells are constructed, and the queen lays eggs in them, then the colony changes its behavior.
   Foraging slows down, and the workers begin erratic movements within the hive. 
 
   
### 7. How would you design beehive behavior in light of this video:

   The bees like the robots in the video moves in relation to each other, one bee could activate an algorithm for all others bees and make them start  moving in cohesion for example one bee can find a source of food, she want to tell all the others bees what she had found, she does it by time of waggling, the direction of waggling in relation to the hive indicates direction of the source of food for example 1 second of waggling to the left mean approximately 750m to the left in relation to the hive.
   
   Beehive attacked by bears cause natural response that  make the bees  rise up together and defend their queen just like the robot when its get the command to        move, building a tower or creating the letter K.
